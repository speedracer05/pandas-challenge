# pandas-challenge
The Pandas-challenge is a project that uses simulated purchase data from a fantasy video game -- Heros of Pymoli. The assignment is to analyze the data, and generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. The project involves using Jupiter notebook, pandas dataframes, and numpy to create a script to analyze the financial records of the fictious game. The following insights were identified:
* Player Count
* Purchasing Analysis (Total)
* Gender Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
* Age Demographics
* Top Spenders
* Most Popular Items
* Most Profitable Items

The purchase_data csv was read into as a panda csv, and loaded in-memory. Next DataFrame objects were created and manipulated to customize and reshape the data sets for further analysis. Additionaly panda's cut function was utilized to separate data array elements into different bins to perform analysis on scalar data. The final information was formatted to provide a cleaner presentation. 

## Key Takeaway
* There were 576 active customers, driving $2.4K in Total revenue, comprised of 780 purchases, with an average Sales price of $3.05.
* Sales occured across all 179 titles, but were concentrated 
Gender Demographics

## Getting Started

You will need to load the Panda script, HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb into Jupyter notebook, with "purchase_data.csv". 

The following output will be printed to the terminal:
Total Months: 86
Total Revenue: $38382578
Average Revenue Change: $6269
Greatest Increase in Profit: Feb-2012 ($1926159) 
Greatest Decrease in Profit: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition a text file of the same output is written to a file named, "Report_PyBank.txt"
