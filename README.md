# pandas-challenge
The Pandas-challenge is a project that uses simulated purchase data from a fantasy video game -- Heros of Pymoli. The assignment is to analyze the data, and generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. The project involves using Jupiter notebook, pandas dataframes, and numpy to create a script to analyze the financial records of the fictious game. The following insights were identified:
* Player Count
* Purchasing Analysis (Total)
* Gender Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
* Age Demographics
* Top Spenders
* Most Popular Items
* Most Profitable Items

List and String variables were created. I then used two forLoops; one to calculate the change in revenue over the period, and using it to create a list; the other was used to find the greatest gain and decrease in revenue, as well as calculate the change in revenue.  

## Getting Started

You will need to load the Python script main.py. into an editor. Visual Studio was used to create this script. A resource file named budget_data.csv was used to extract the data.

The following output will be printed to the terminal:
Total Months: 86
Total Revenue: $38382578
Average Revenue Change: $6269
Greatest Increase in Profit: Feb-2012 ($1926159) 
Greatest Decrease in Profit: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition a text file of the same output is written to a file named, "Report_PyBank.txt"
